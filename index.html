      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p><strong>Manhunt Kit</strong>, is a concept put together by Minecraft players, inspired by the famous content creator ‘Dream’. Manhunt kit is an inventory full of mixed and matched items, related to Dream’s famous challenge “Manhunt”, containing worldly items such as pearls, knockback sword, TNT, cobwebs, fishing rod, lava, and many more.</p>
      <p>The goal of the kit was to replicate the Manhunt experience in the PvP kit server known as ‘PvP Legacy’. This kit stood out different from any other, popularizing in the gamemode ‘Custom ?v?’, solely due to being given the thrill of being hunted, and chasing players down.</p>
      <p>This simple concept attracted the eyes of thousands, even some of Minecraft’s best fighters, and biggest content creators. Till this day, the community grows bigger than ever, in hopes to feel the thrill others experienced many years ago.</p>

    <section id="tab-2020" class="tab-content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-2020-btn" hidden>
      <h2>2020: Dawn of a New</h2>
      <h3 class="highlight">Bwilliance; The Creator</h3>
      <p>With the newfound rise of popular Minecraft Content creator ‘Dream’, came significant attention to his viral challenge “Manhunt”. The concept of Manhunt is simple: 1 player is chosen to beat the game before every other player can kill him.</p>
      <p>The concept of freeworld PvP and a wild variety of items and strategies is what interested some players, among those players is one named Bwilliance.</p>
      <p>Bwilliance, in search of a 1.9+ PvP server back in 2020, came across a server called ‘PvP Legacy’. PvP Legacy is a custom kits server, meaning you can fight anyone, with anything, with no limitations.</p>
      <p>Bwilliance, whilst experimenting on the server, came across a certain map; “Natural Forest”.</p>
      <h3 class="highlight">Natural Forest</h3>
      <p>This map created a connection to Bwilliance, as she realized how similar it was to normal vanilla generation. After looking further into the tools in the custom kit server, she also realized it had the items necessary to replicate an average inventory used in a Manhunt, sparking the creation of what's now known as, ‘Manhunt Kit’.</p>
      <p>Bwilliance spent days tweaking this kit overtime, as it wasn’t perfect due to the server’s limitations. She used this kit originally to play 1v1s just for fun, and some of her opponents also found her kit intriguing, some even asking for the kit for themselves, specifically; Ronalmar, Dowqe, & 1aye.</p>
      <p>These players started to make this kit their own, by adding, removing, and tweaking minor details into their own unique manhunt kit.</p>
      <p><em>The First Ever Manhunt Kit; Bwilliance’s kit | Made November, 2020</em></p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/bwilliance-kit.png" alt="Bwilliance's Kit" />
        <figcaption>The First Ever Manhunt Kit; Bwilliance’s kit</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Eventually these few players started using this kit in a gamemode called Custom ?v?, a mode where any amount of players can fit in 2 teams, up to 10 players per team.</p>
      <p>With this rapid exposition to up to 20 players at a time, the kit began to popularize exponentially, being shared left and right, many players had the kit and began tweaking it in their own unique way as well.</p>
      <p>Whilst it was growing popular fast, it was still very new to many. Players were often confused upon seeing the kit so the kit owners often had to explain its purpose and how to play.</p>
      <p>In the short few months that Manhunt Kit had spread, a select few players that stood out from the rest were able to become some of the first pro manhunt players; <strong>Ronalmar, 1aye, MegaMrTota, gluuuuuuuuuuuu, Bwilliance, and Dowqe.</strong> These 6 players are known as; <strong>The First Generation.</strong></p>

      <h3 class="highlight">Ronalmar & 1aye; The Meta Brothers</h3>
      <p>Ronalmar and 1aye were 2 of the most revolutionary players of all time, even up to 4 years later their impact can be seen in every manhunt game.</p>
      <p>Ronalmar and 1aye joined PvP Legacy 2 years prior to the initial creation of Manhunt Kit, and once they discovered the kit itself made by Bwilliance, they were driven to find metas to change the game.</p>
      <p>In just the few months of their first finding of the kit, they managed to create some of the most significant technology even to this day, with things such as TNT Rodding, piston cannons, KB carting, spray cannons, and some game breaking bugs.</p>
      <p>When the 2 of them first started playing Manhunt Kit, a problem kept occurring to them: anytime they had been outnumbered, say 5v1, not even the best player in the world could win in raw PvP.</p>
      <p>This problem was bigger than many think, due to the big teams that go up to 10 players against 10 players.</p>
      <p>To solve this, the 2 of them developed trapping strats, and the entire concept of skybasing into Manhunt Kit.</p>
      <p>They were the first to successfully take advantage of skybasing, and with the combination of TNT rodding, the 2 of them deemed unstoppable to many others.</p>
      <p>With just a few short months, these 2 players created the most game changing tech known to manhunt, and unknowingly, shaped the entire revolutionary history for years to come.</p>

    <section id="tab-2021" class="tab-content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-2021-btn" hidden>
      <h2>2021: The Nova Era</h2>
      <p>2021 was seemingly the era producing the most plentiful players that still conquer manhunt to this day.</p>
      <p>As 2020 was the year of producing and shaping Manhunt Kit as a whole, 2021 was solely dedicated to player growth and adaptation.</p>
      <p>With the constant popularity and rise of the gamemode, the people it reached spread like wildfire causing hundreds of newcomers within just months.</p>
      <p>And with such a variety of sculpted categories and skills, players stopped focusing on figuring out the kit, and figuring out what category of playstyle they fell under.</p>
      <p>Manhunt Kit skills mainly fall under the following categories; <strong>PvP, TNT, Skybasing, Clutching, and Trapping.</strong></p>
      <p>This wide variety of skill sets is what made Manhunt Kit unique, giving each player a set of strengths and weaknesses.</p>
      <p>The average player falls under at least 1 category, which is what they are commonly used to.</p>
      <p>Majority of players had fallen under the PvP category, but soon after the revolution of TNT, players started spreading their skill sets.</p>
      <p>Soon some players mastered both PvP and TNT, posing a bigger threat.</p>
      <p>And yet the more they played some even mastered up to 3 different categories.</p>
      <p>With the sudden rise of players, the lobbies had become more challenging than ever, but that only pushed players to grow even further.</p>
      <p>And by mid 2021, The Nova Era, had produced some of the greatest 10v10ers, that even 3 years later, are still some of the most terrifying individuals to this day.</p>
      <p>Players such as; <strong>Nen8, Unglowing, Blozer, wwomp, Dreammn, Promprero, 227ping, Farwelll, Zypol, MachineGunX, StatusTaken, Roiii, 1Nxnja, NotSoJelly</strong>, and many more.</p>
      <p>These players would total to around 30 if not more, that had all fully grasped at <strong>LEAST 2 different categories</strong>, some more than others.</p>

      <p>Naturally, when hundreds of players that shared the same passion with one another, played with one another daily, friendships formed.</p>
      <p>The gamemode itself started to feel like a true community, with some friends groups here and there.</p>
      <p>SMP’s started to form, with some of the top players, building connections to one another.</p>
      <p>And as the community started to feel more and more whole, 2 players; <strong>Dowqe, and gluuuuuuuuuuu</strong>, had created the first ever discord server, “?v? Custom Hangout”.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">Custom ?v? Hangout | Created Oct 31st, 2021</h3>
      <p>This discord server initially started off small, inviting only some of the most elite players during The Nova Era.</p>
      <p>And with people being friends with others, naturally more and more got invited, till over a hundred 10v10ers created an active friendly community server.</p>
      <p>The Manhunt Kit community was stronger, and closer than ever, with the elite players being able to talk to one another,
      <p>The Manhunt Kit community was stronger, and closer than ever, with the elite players being able to talk to one another, strategize, and organize games.</p>
      <p>This server became the central hub for all things related to Manhunt Kit and the Custom ?v? gamemode, facilitating growth and competition like never before.</p>

        <figcaption>The first ever Custom ?v? Hangout Discord server</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>With this newfound organization, players began hosting official events and tournaments, boosting the gamemode’s visibility and legitimacy.</p>
      <p>These competitive events pushed players to innovate new tactics and raise the overall skill ceiling.</p>
      <p><em>Community spirit and competitiveness both flourished throughout 2021, cementing The Nova Era as a pivotal chapter in Manhunt Kit’s history.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="tab-2022" class="tab-content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-2022-btn" hidden>
      <h2>2022: Corruption and Conflict</h2>
      <p>As the community grew, so did tensions and rivalries between clans and top players.</p>
      <p>2022 marked a year of both growth and strife, with the emergence of power struggles that threatened the harmony of the Custom ?v? scene.</p>
      <p>Several popular clans competed fiercely for dominance, each trying to claim the title of the best 10v10 team.</p>
      <p>This led to increased drama both in-game and in community spaces such as Discord, with some rivalries spilling into heated debates and personal conflicts.</p>
      <p>At the same time, some players exploited bugs and glitches to gain unfair advantages, causing controversy and calls for stricter rules.</p>
      <p>Despite these challenges, the gameplay itself continued to evolve, as players adapted to meta shifts and new playstyles emerged.</p>
      <p><strong>Key events from 2022 include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The rise of the infamous ‘ShadowClan’, known for their aggressive tactics and mastery of TNT strategies.</li>
        <li>The introduction of new custom maps, adding fresh challenges and opportunities for innovation.</li>
        <li>A major patch that fixed long-standing bugs but also unintentionally nerfed some popular techs.</li>
        <li>High-profile tournaments that showcased intense rivalries and spectacular plays.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Though the community was tested by internal conflicts, the passion for Manhunt Kit never waned.</p>
      <p><em>Many players view 2022 as a crucible year that forged stronger bonds and refined the competitive spirit.</em></p>

    <section id="tab-2023" class="tab-content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-2023-btn" hidden>
      <h2>2023: Blossoming and Withering</h2>
      <p>2023 was a year of contrasts — both growth and decline were witnessed within the Manhunt Kit community.</p>
      <p>On one hand, the community saw an influx of fresh faces and new talents who brought renewed energy and creativity.</p>
      <p>On the other, veteran players began to step back, some retiring from competitive play, while others faced burnout.</p>
      <p>Events and tournaments continued but with mixed attendance, reflecting the shifting dynamics of the player base.</p>
      <p>The meta also saw radical changes, with experimentation leading to novel strategies and the rediscovery of old techniques.</p>
      <p>Community projects, including fan-made maps and mods, blossomed, showcasing the creativity inspired by Manhunt Kit.</p>

        <figcaption>Community event bringing players together in 2023</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>However, challenges remained. The player base’s fragmentation into smaller groups caused difficulties in organizing large-scale games.</p>
      <p>Many players expressed hope for a resurgence, yearning for the days when the community was unified and thriving.</p>
      <p><em>2023 was thus a pivotal year of transition, both a blossoming of creativity and a withering of old traditions.</em></p>
